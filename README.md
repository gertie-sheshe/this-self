# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, built using MaterialUI and NextJS.

This project is a work in progress and I'm constantly looking for ways to make the experience better. If you have any ideas or run into any issues, please take a look at the [project tasks](https://github.com/users/gertie-sheshe/projects/2) first to see if I am already working on it. But if you can't find anything, feel free to open a new issue and I'll be sure to take a look and do my best to address it promptly.
